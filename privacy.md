# DeepFake Detector Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
DeepFake Detector captures frames from videos you choose to analyze. These video frames are sent to our API for deepfake detection analysis.

## Data Usage
The captured video frames are used solely for the purpose of detecting potential deepfake manipulations. Our AI model analyzes these frames and provides a result indicating whether the video appears to be authentic or manipulated.

## Data Storage
Video frames are processed in real-time and are not permanently stored on our servers. Analysis results (whether a video was detected as deepfake or authentic) are stored locally in your browser for history purposes.

## Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. All processing is done on our secure servers.

## User Control
You can clear your analysis history at any time through the extension's interface. No personal information is collected or stored.
